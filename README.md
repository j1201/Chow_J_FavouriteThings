# Chow_J_FavouriteThings

## About the Project
This is an one-page web app that showcases three of my favorite things. There will be interactive buttons with relevant data pulling from a JSON file conducted on the page. To make the page more interesting, I also implemented animation with GSAP library. 

Here is my [development plan] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YMQB8rZA7igDQwDwd_P2S7R676Z0GD-twND6h5vkJoM/edit?usp=sharing)
